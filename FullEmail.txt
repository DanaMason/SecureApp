Hello,

I was just curious if the project proposal I sent in was good enough for the CSC 234 course you are teaching this summer? I was wanting to wait until you gave the OK on it but also am concerned about the time left for the project. 

Any information would help! 

Thanks!

Mason,

I'll admit, this does sound like a lot for the time we have. What would your plan be for getting this done in the time left? What type of application would it be?

I'm always up for encouraging you to challenge yourself, and you would learn a lot doing this, but I'd be cautious, it's probably too much, as written.

Thanks,

Hello,

I think for a plan I could probably get the password retrieval and encryption system done this week. Then, for next week I could work on hashing and the 2-Step Authentication. Then for the third week I could implement the database feature in it (for retrieving the password and the account amount). Finally, for the fourth week, I could use it to finalize the app, ensure everything is setup correctly, and finally make the presentation. 

I think that I would need to probably compromise with the time requirement and put things like SQL Injection and XSS prevention in the backseat for this project. Additionally, it would probably be a demonstration application on secure features, and not very functional. It would likely just display a fixed figure. Maybe with a deposit/withdrawal feature if time permits.

Additionally, I think I would be able to complete these new criteria because I have experience with password retrieval and encryption from this class, and I have prior file manipulation experience. I would need to learn about the authentication and hashing but that would be part of the learning process. 

Furthermore, I believe that this would accurately reflect what I have learned this semester about some security related topics, as well as prove my knowledge expansion on my own on programming things I haven't worked with before.

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated and if that all sounds good to you, I'll get started on it. If not, please let me know your thoughts/comments/concerns.

Thank you!

I think it's good to prioritize these features, so if you run short on time you have an expectation of a 'version 1' most important features kind of thing.

I think an app that's more an exhibition of security features vs functionality is quite appropriate for this class.

I'd say get started :-)
